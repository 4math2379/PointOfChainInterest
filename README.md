# Point of chain interest
## Concept
**Today Blockchain services use a lot of energy.**

**Creating a Decentralised localisation service for integration and use by a Community and/or other online services. This project is currently still quite abstract for me, however, my idea behind it is to compensate and potentially overcome the energy-consuming facet of the blockchain by allowing and incentivizing users to trace their actions with positive impact on society or environment (such as simple Green actions of picking up waste in the street or nature).**


The purpose is to use [fileCoins](https://docs.filecoin.io/how-to/install-filecoin/) network in order to build a Wiki location services.

for the Mapping services :earth_americas: , i use [Mapobox](https://www.mapbox.com/).



The value for potential users are to share  **anonimously** their interest on the map and the objective is to share an  action for the envionnement.
