# Point of chain interest
## Concept
**Today Blockchain services use a lot of energy.**

**Making a *Decentralised localisation services* use a Network and many other online services. 
This project are totaly abstract for me, because i wan't to compensate  the energy-consuming facet by allowing the user to make an action for the climat or a simple *Green* action.**


The purpose is to use [fileCoins](https://docs.filecoin.io/how-to/install-filecoin/) network in order to build a Wiki location services.

for the Mapping services :earth_americas: , i use [Mapobox](https://www.mapbox.com/).



The value for potential users are to share  **anonimously** their interest on the map and the objective is to share an  action for the envionnement.
