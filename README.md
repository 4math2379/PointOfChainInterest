# Point of chain interest
## Concept
**Today Blockchain services use a lot of energy.**

**Creating a Decentralised localisation service for integration and use by a Community and/or other online services. This project is currently still quite abstract for me, however, my idea behind it is to compensate and potentially overcome the energy-consuming facet of the blockchain by allowing and incentivizing users to trace their actions with positive impact on society or environment (such as simple Green actions of picking up waste in the street or nature).**




For the Mapping services :earth_americas: , i use [Mapobox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

For the logging a Simple Storage *Smart contract* with a *Metamask* injection.

When users accept the Smart contract, if he hold some ERC720 Tokens they can marked
a Point Of Interest (POI). The marked action will be hashed and publish in the IPFS network.

By this action, users will only share their data of the location , their ETH address and the hash
of the transaction.
 
The value for potential users are to share  **anonimously** their interest on the map and the objective is to share an  action for the environnement.


## The Eco or Green actions üìó :green_apple:
1. Purely a concept: Imagine you cleaning a beach or a borders river  in your city ? Or helping
anyone to clean the streets of cigarettes butt ?

2. Just mark it on the Map , other user who travel near the position can see it and participate.

## Being Anonymous and adding POI with a hash 
 - [x] Using IPFS Network üîì
 - [ ] Using the IPFS tech in order to **PIN** the coordinates.
 - [ ] Connect to a public Blockchain ‚õìÔ∏è
 - [x] connect to Geojson for testing charting dataset :earth_africa:
 - [ ] Create Web3 injection. üíä
